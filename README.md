# Rust64 - a C64 emulator written in Rust
This is my attempt to study the Rust programming language and have fun at the same time. The goal is to present in a concise and non-obfuscated way how the C64 works and what's happening behind the scenes once you start a program. Emulation is cycle based and fairly accurate at this point.

Dependencies
------------------
- minifb: https://crates.io/crates/minifb
- sdl2: https://crates.io./crates/sdl2

Requires Rust 1.5.0 or higher to compile and run.

The emulator comes with a memory debugger which lets you view the current state of each memory page in RAM, VIC registers, CIA registers, SID registers and Color RAM. The VIC window is a ICU64-style raster debugger, each pixel representing one VIC cycle and events associated with it. For performance reasons, the windows are updated once per C64 frame.

Build instructions
------------------
```
cargo build
cargo run --release
```

You can pass a .prg file as a command line parameter to load it into memory once the emulators boots (type RUN to start the program):
```
cargo run --release prgs/colors.prg
```
To run with double-sized window:
```
cargo run --release x2 prgs/colors.prg
```
To run with double-sized window and debug windows enabled:
```
cargo run --release x2 debugger prgs/colors.prg
```

C64 and special key mappings
-------------------
```
ESC     - Run/Stop
END     - Restore
TAB     - Control
LCTRL   - C=
`       - <-
-       - +
INS     - &
HOME    - CLR/Home
BSPACE  - INST/DEL
[       - @
]       - *
DEL     - ^
;       - :
'       - ;
\       - =
F11     - start asm output to console (very slow!)
F12     - reset C64
RCTRL   - joystick fire button
NUMLOCK - toggle between joystick ports 1 and 2 (default: port 2)

In debugger window:
PGUP/PGDWN - flip currently displayed memory page
HOME/END   - change currently displayed memory banks between RAM, Color RAM, VIC, CIA and SID
```

TODO
------------------
- serial bus/disk drives (d64, t64)
- implement remaining undocumented ops
- switch from SDL2 to cpal for audio once it supports OSX
- improve SID emulation

Known Issues
------------------
- Due to lack of any serial bus handling, some programs may not perform correctly or get stuck in infinite loops.
- elaborate programs that require incredibly precise timing are not running correctly yet

This is an on-off WIP project, so update frequency may vary.
