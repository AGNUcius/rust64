# Rust64 - a C64 emulator written in Rust
Some people learn a new language with "Hello world". Others toy around with it implementing amazing graphical effects. I decided to write a C64 emulator. 

From scratch. 

Learning on the fly. 

Yup. 

Currently depends on rust-sdl2 bindings, follow the readme here to compile: https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2

Updates:

2/9/2015
Expect a lot of changes to be happening in the entire code structure as I implement more components and remaster everything with new Rust features I run into. The emulator is not in a usable state at the moment and you will have a tough time trying to compile it with default settings. This will all change as the emulator reaches more mature stage. Stay tuned for more updates in this spot.
